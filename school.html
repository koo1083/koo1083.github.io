    <h1 class="orange">Extracurricular Activities!</h1>
    <h2 class="white">This side is all about the clubs and sports that I do in Hoffman Estates High School. </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Badminton</li>
        <li>BPA</li>
        <li>Interact Club</li>
        <li>Social Studies Club</li>
        <li>Math Team</li>
        <li>Jazz Band</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Out of all these activities, my favorite ones are badminton and social studies club.
        <br><br>
        First of all, badminton is a fun sport because
        <br>you make a lot of new friends that you bond with during the season.

        <br>
        Secondly, I really like social studies club because my friends are in it as well, and the club gives us a chance to participate in meaningful events such as volunteering for feed my starving children.

            The electives that I'm taking this year are Spanish 3, AP Computer Science, and Band.
            <br> For me personally, AP computer science is my favorite elective class.
            <br>On the other hand, I'm currently struggling in math where we're learning trigonometry and calculus.
            <br><br>
            This is my schedule for this school year:
